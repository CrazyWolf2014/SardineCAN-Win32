- default filter behaviour: J2534-2 states it is BLOCK ALL by default. Subsequent BLOCK_FILTERS can be used to block messages passed otherwise by PASS_FILTER
 So it is like this: BLOCK ALL unless msg matches PASS_FILTER & none of the BLOCK_FILTER match

- try initializing Arduino again in PassthruConnect, if it wasn't initialized when first opening the DLL

- add PASS/BLOCK filter functionality


- arduino sometimes doesn't assemble messages correctly. Should assemble according to newline, but for some reasing it completes assembly even when there should'nt be newline(?)
