===== Sardine.cpp & Registry.cpp ==========================================
- Multiple device support 

===== Protocol.cpp ==========================================
- Write buffer unimplemented. Currently writing blocks

===== ProtocolCAN ==========================================
- RTR messages (?)
- BIT_SAMPLE_POINT & SYNC_JUMP_WIDTH

===== ISO 15765 =============================
- No flow control / message disassembly implemented
- CAN_MIXED_FORMAT

===== ISO 9141 ================================
- Everything :)

===== DLL<->Arduino Communication ================

===== Arduino  & DLL<->Arduino communication =========================================
- default filter behaviour: J2534-2 states it is BLOCK ALL by default. Subsequent BLOCK_FILTERS can be used to block messages passed otherwise by PASS_FILTER
 So it is like this: BLOCK ALL unless msg matches PASS_FILTER & none of the BLOCK_FILTER match

- add PASS/BLOCK filter functionality to Arduino (currently hard-coded to accept 00 80 xx xx)
- Read firmware version and battery voltage 
- commands for filter handling
- Read & Set data rate (CAN/ISO15765/ISO9141)
- Pin switching
- BIT_SAMPLE_POINT & SYNC_JUMP_WIDTH (CAN)


- Arduino error code handling!

===== Miscellaneous ===================================
- Load debugging log file names and paths as well as debug filters from Windows registry (now hard coded).
- Get & set programming voltage

==== BUGS =============================================
- arduino sometimes doesn't assemble messages correctly. Parsing should end to newline, but for some reasing it completes assembly even when there should'nt be newline(?)
