Sardine CAN - Windows DLL version 0.3 alpha (Copyright Olaf @ Hacking volvo blog (hackingvolvo.blogspot.com). E-mail: hackingvolvo@gmail.com

This is Sardine CAN, an open source J2534 device, which makes it possible to connect various diagnostic programs (eg. VIDA from Volvo) to your car.

Starting from version 0.3 alpha the Sardine CAN DLL now uses Lawicel CANUSB/CAN232 protocol by default.
(see http://www.canusb.com/documents/canusb_manual.pdf for more information). This makes it possible to use programs supporting either
J2534 or CANUSB protocol with both the SardineCAN hardware as well as original Lawicel devices!

Files in this repository are only for the Windows DLL. You also need Arduino firmware ( available in github.com/hackingvolvo/SardineCAN-Arduino )

Before doing anything else, please read DISCLAIMER.txt!
