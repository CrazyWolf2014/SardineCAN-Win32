Thanks goes to Joey Oravec <joravec@drewtech.com> of Drewtech for the Open Source J2534-1 tool! Few debugging functions as well as the J2534 parameters
and function definitions were copied from its sources (j2534_v0404.h, shim_debug.cpp, shim_debug.h)  Also their SAE J2534 API reference was
quite helpful.

A lot of code snippets from MSDN were used here and there.
